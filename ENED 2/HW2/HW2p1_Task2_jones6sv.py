# A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE SCRIPT OR FUNCTION DOES
# 
# Antoine‚Äôs Equation describes the relationship between vapor pressure and temperature for a pure 
# substance.  The equation is: log10(ùëÉ)=A‚àí (B/(C+T))
# P = vapor pressure (mmHg) 
# T = temperature (oC) 
# A, B, C are constants that depend on the substance
#
# Prompt the user for the substance (Methanol, Butane, or Octane)
#Check to make sure the substance entered is valid.  If not, continue to prompt until a valid substance is entered. 
# a loop will certainly prove useful for creating the list of temperature.  The list of temperatures will be different for each substance.

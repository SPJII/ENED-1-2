# Hookeâ€™s law is an equation for how much force is required to compress or stretch a spring by a 
# certain amount: 
#HookesLaw function F = K*X
# A higher spring constant means that the spring is more difficult to  compress or stretch. Springs 
# can be combined in series or in parallel as shown in the diagram below. 
# Develop a Python function, Springs, that has the following input arguments: spring constants, the 
# total force, and the configuration (series or parallel). The function should check to make sure that 
# K1, K2, and Ftotal are positive numbers. For invalid inputs, the function should output an error 
# message to the user. For valid inputs, the program should return Keq, F1, F2, x1, x2, and xtotal.
